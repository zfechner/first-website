<h1>About the project ðŸ’»</h1>
This is my first front-end project that I created to work on my web development skills. 
It's basic, but it gave me a chance to practice HTML and CSS. 
The project is sopposed to be a blog tamplate that can still be develop and change by adding new functionality. 


There is couple of basic windows that user can navigate between:
<ul>
  <li>Home window</li>
  <li>Contact window</li>
  <li>About window</li>
  <li>Blog window</li>
  <li>Blog post window</li>
</ul>

Every window is responsive.
